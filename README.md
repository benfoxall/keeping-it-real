A talk about VR for web developers

---

With ever-more-accessible hardware and native support in web platforms, virtual reality is set to become part of our daily lives, both as consumers and developers. Ben Foxall explores the features and capabilities of WebVR, showing how it can be used to create meaningful (and useful) applications, and explains how uniquely complementary this is to the rest of our web platform.

Topics include:

* The features and capabilities required of VR displays and controls and how these are provided using existing and new browser APIs
* How VR fits into our current web experiences, looking at the UX of someone visiting a web page and transitioning to a virtual reality context
* Creating meaningful virtual experiences, focusing on real-world data and letting visualization principles guide the “usefulness” of an interaction
* How WebVR represents a unique opportunity to enhance existing content and what the future might hold from the way we interact with content
