Overall goals:

* As a web developer - you're in a great place to make use of VR
* this is going to be as boring as possible

Overall Structure:

* What features make this work
* What things can we take from the web to make VR awesome

Points:

* magic window - devices like tango might be a VR display, but not a headset
* supporting multiple devices - think like media queries, break on content, not try to box in devices
* requestAnimationFrame 90fps
* urls on the web - if two people can use the same skybox, that's huge

Places to find VR content:

* A week of a-frame - https://aframe.io/blog/
* https://www.webvrexperiments.com
* http://vrlist.io (no https? doesn't seem updating)


Boring use cases: training,
